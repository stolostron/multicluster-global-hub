# Getting Started

This document is aimed to provide an example about how to connect to the kafka and consume the message which is generated by the managed hub. In this way, you can get the message from ACM and push to your owned system.

- **consumer**: create a separate consumer which can receive message from the managed hubs.

## Prerequisites

These instructions assume:

- You need to have a global hub setup successfully. You can choose to [setup a global hub environment on the OCP](https://github.com/stolostron/multicluster-global-hub/blob/main/README.md). If you do not have OCP, you can also run `make e2e-setup` to [create a local one in your linux machine](https://github.com/stolostron/multicluster-global-hub/blob/719606de0a65eb8d62c9b10932ef8614bc39ccd0/Makefile#L71).

Set environment variables.
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=</path/to/global_hub_cluster/kubeconfig>
export SECRET_NAMESPACE=<transport-secret-namespace> # default SECRET_NAMESPACE=multicluster-global-hub
export SECRET_NAME=<transport-secret-name> # default SECRET_NAME=multicluster-global-hub-transport
```
