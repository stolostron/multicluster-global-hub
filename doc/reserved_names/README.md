| Label                                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/managed-by=`global-hub-operator\|global-hub\|global-hub-agent` | If the value is `global-hub-operator`, the resources are created by the global hub operator. The global hub operator watches the resources based on this label.                                                                                     |
| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/global-resource=                                               | This label is added when creating the global resources. It is used to identify the resource that transport needs to propagate to the managed hub clusters.                                                                                               |
| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/agent-deploy-mode = `Hosted\| Default\| None`                  | This label is used on ManagedCluster.<br>`Hosted` means the global hub agent is deployed on Hosting cluster.<br>`Default` means the global hub agent is deployed on managed cluster.<br>`None` means the global hub agent is not installed. |
| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/hub-cluster-install=                                           | This label is used on ManagedCluster. If this label exists, the global hub operator installs Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management on a managed cluster. If the label is not included, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management is not installed on the managed cluster by the global hub operator.                                          |
| global-hub.open-cluster-management.io/metrics-resource=`strimzi\|postgres` | It's used to identify the resource owned by enableMetrics, if the enableMetrics is disabled, these resources should be removed. |
